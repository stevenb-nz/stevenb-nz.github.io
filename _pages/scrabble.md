### old tournament scoring program

There are two .dmg's available for download - T-Score 1.4.2 compiled for i) [PPC Macs](/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.2(PPC).dmg) or ii) [Intel Macs](/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.2(Intel).dmg). The PPC version hasn't been tested as I no longer have easy access to a PPC-based machine (or even one running Rosetta).

### implementation of new ratings system

I have reviewed the old ratings system, recommended changes, had these changes adopted, and implemented the new system. I will link to a description of the new system, sufficient for someone else to do their own implementation, once I have written this description.

### links to current rankings and ratings from the new system
