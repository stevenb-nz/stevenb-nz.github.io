### changes to the ratings system in 2017, 2019 and 2022

In 2015-16, I reviewed the 1999 ratings system, recommended changes, had these changes adopted, and implemented the new system for 2017. Here are: the two reports analysing the old system and recommending the new system; and a description of the calculations that are carried out in the new system.

In late 2018 / early 2019, a group of New Zealand Scrabble players, including myself, undertook the review of the 2017 changes that I recommended in my report above. Here is: our final report, which was adopted on 26/1/2019; and the code for the current implementation of both the 2017 and 2019 systems.

In 2021, I recommended minor changes to the 2019 system to better handle some rare situations, and to make the system simpler, and thus easier to understand and implement.

### old tournament scoring program

There are two .dmg's available for download - T-Score 1.4.4 compiled for i) [PPC Macs](/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.4(PPC).dmg) or ii) [Intel Macs](/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.4(Intel).dmg). The PPC version hasn't been tested as I no longer have easy access to a PPC-based machine (or even one running Rosetta).
This is the last update to the old version of T-Score - the old IDE no longer supports current machines.
