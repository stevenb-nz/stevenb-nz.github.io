Most urgent further work.

- finish implementation guide

- way to decide trans-tasman qualifiers (with flexibility for when criteria change)
-- does this always involve a 'qualifying period'?

- easy way to rate two tournaments together (formalise current manual process)
-- provide for draft status for tournaments?
