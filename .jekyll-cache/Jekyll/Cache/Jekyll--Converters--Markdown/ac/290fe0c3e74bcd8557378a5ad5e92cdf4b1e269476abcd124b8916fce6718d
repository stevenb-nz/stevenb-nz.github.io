I"z<h1 class="page-title">About me</h1>

<p>Hi, I’m Steven. The first code I ever wrote was at the age of 13. We wrote some Fortran on graph paper in maths class, mailed it off to a mainframe to get run, and received the results several weeks later.</p>

<p>Some years later I completed a Computer Science major and worked in computer support for the next ten years. My career then took a different direction, working to support various Parliamentary functions for another ten years (mainly in publishing to web and print, and drafting written reports).</p>

<p>More recently, I’ve retrained as a web developer, specialising in Ruby on Rails, along with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. I’d very much like to begin working as a developer, and I’m happy to consider any position that would make good use of my skills and experience (particularly in the Wellington, New Zealand region, or remote). If there’s anything you’d like to suggest, please get in touch!</p>
