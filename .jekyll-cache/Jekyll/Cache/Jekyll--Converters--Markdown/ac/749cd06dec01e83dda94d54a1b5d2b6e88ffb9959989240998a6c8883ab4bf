I"©<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 18 was: Project 1, part three.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Managed to achieve all three challenges in about 15-20 minutes, so I seem to be learning something.</p>
