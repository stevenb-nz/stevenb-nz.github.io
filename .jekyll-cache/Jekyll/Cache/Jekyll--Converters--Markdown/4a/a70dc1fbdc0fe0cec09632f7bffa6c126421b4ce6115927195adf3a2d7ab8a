I"6<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 27 was: Project 5, Part One.</p>

<p>This included: Capture lists in Swift: what’s the difference between weak, strong, and unowned references?; Setting up; Reading from disk: contentsOfFile; and Pick a word, any word: UIAlertController.</p>

<p>Not feeling very well today - this all seems a bit fuzzy at the moment, but hopefully something is sinking in.</p>
