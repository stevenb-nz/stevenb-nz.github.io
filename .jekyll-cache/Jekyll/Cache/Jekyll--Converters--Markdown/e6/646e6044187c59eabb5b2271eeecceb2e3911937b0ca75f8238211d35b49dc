I"Å<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 19 was Challenge day. The challenge was to write your own SwiftUI App, to do conversions between different units for a particular physical quantity. I chose temperature, with Celcius as the canonical unit between Fahrenheit and Kelvin.</p>
