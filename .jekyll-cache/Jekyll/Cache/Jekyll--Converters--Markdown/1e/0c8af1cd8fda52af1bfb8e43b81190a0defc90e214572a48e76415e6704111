I"Í<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 69 was: Project 19, Part Three.</p>

<p>This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 19, and some challenges. Project 19 seemed to stop working as I was finishing off Part Two - the Action button stopped appearing in Safari, first when I first switched to iPhone SE for the simulator, and then for the iPhone XR after Iâ€™d switched back to that simulator and changed the code that was meant to fix things for the iPhone SE. Could well have been a change brought in with xCode 10.2.1, or something I didnâ€™t reinstall after updating to that version. Whatever, I canâ€™t work on the challenges for that project until itâ€™s working again. Will carry on getting caught up elsewhere, and try doing Project 19 from scratch when I return to it.</p>
