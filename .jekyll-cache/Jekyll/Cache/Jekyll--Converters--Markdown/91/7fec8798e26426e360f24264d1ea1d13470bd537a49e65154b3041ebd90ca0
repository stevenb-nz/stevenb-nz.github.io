I"»<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 44 was: Project 9, part 2.</p>

<p>This included: Transforming shapes using CGAffineTransform and even-odd fills; Creative borders and fills using ImagePaint; and Enabling high-performance Metal rendering with drawingGroup().</p>
