I"<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 64 was: Project 18, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Basic Swift debugging using print(); Debugging with assert(); Debugging with breakpoints; and View debugging.</p>

<p>Looks like XCode has some pretty decent debugging tools. Will have to see how easy and/or useful they are in practice.</p>
