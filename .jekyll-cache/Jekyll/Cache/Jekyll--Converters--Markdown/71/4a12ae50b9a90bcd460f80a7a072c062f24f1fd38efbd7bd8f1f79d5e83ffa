I"Î<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 81 was: Project 24, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 24, and some challenges.</p>

<p>The challenges are all String extensions - looking forward to working on them once Iâ€™m caught up to that point.</p>
