I"¥<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 35 was: Project 7, Part Three.</p>

<p>This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 7. And some challenges, which I might not get to until tomorrow given how sleepy Iâ€™m starting to feel.</p>
