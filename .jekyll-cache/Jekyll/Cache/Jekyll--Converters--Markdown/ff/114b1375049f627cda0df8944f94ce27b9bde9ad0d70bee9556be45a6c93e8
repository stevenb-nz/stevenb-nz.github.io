I"Ì<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 88 was: Project 27, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Creating the sandbox; Drawing into a Core Graphics context with UIGraphicsImageRenderer; Ellipses and checkerboards; Transforms and lines; and Images and text.</p>

<p>All good stuff.</p>
