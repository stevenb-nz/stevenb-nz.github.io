I"`<p>i) figured out how to get around a problem in the Xojo IDE. The program for the new NZ Scrabble ratings system started out with 5 tab panels, but one was dropped during the initial development. I’ve gotten to the stage where I now want to add the 5th tab panel (as number 2 of 5 left to right). It’s easy enough to use the tab panel editor to add a new panel, name it, and drag it into the desired order. But, the tab panels are not referred to by name or title internally, but by their tab panel index (left to right). So, where my tabs were previously 1-Tournament, 2-Player, 3-Awards, 4-Lists; they are now 1-Tournament, 2-Clubs, 3-Player, 4-Awards, 5-Lists. And all the controls to do with (was 2-)players are now on the new (2-)clubs panel, and all the controls to do with (was 4-)lists are now on the (4-)awards panel, with (5-)lists being blank.</p>
