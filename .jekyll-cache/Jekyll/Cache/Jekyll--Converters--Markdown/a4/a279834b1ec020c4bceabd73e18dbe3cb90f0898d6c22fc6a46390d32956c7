I"©<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 9 was: Structs, part two.</p>

<p>This involved watching short videos on: Initializers; Referring to the current instance; Lazy properties; Static properties and methods; Access control; and Structs summary.</p>
