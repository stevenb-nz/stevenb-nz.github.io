I"Ù<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 57 was: Project 15, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Preparing for action; Switch, case, animate: animate(withDuration:); and Transform: CGAffineTransform.</p>

<p>Good animation stuff. Just about asleep though, so not sure how much Iâ€™ll remember.</p>
