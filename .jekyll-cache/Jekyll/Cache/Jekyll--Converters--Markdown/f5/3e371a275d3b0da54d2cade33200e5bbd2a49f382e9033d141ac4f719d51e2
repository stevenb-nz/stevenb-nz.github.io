I"¬<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 48 was: Project 12, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Reading and writing basics: UserDefaults; and Fixing Project 10: NSCoding.</p>

<p>Very useful data persistence stuff. Looking forward to the next day.</p>
