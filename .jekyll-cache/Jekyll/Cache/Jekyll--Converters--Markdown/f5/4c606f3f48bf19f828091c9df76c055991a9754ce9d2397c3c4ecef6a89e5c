I"<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 7 was: Closures, part two.</p>

<p>This involved watching short videos on: Using closures as parameters when they accept parameters; Using closures as parameters when they return values; Shorthand parameter names; Closures with multiple parameters; Returning closures from functions; Capturing values; and Closures summary.</p>
