I"ú<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 78 was: Project 23, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Follow the sequence; Slice to win; and Game over, man: SKTexture.</p>

<p>Nice to recognise things from previous days, with them now making more sense. Game seems a bit unfinished, but suspect this will be one of the next dayâ€™s challenges.</p>
