I"a<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 52 was: Project 13, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Designing the interface; and Importing a picture.</p>

<p>Stuff like using suggested constraints under resolving Auto Layout settings seem to be much clearer here than in previous courses I’ve looked at. Not sure if that’s because I have now seen it before, or if Paul Hudson is better at presenting and explaining the material.</p>
