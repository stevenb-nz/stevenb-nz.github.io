I"§<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 38 was: Project 8, Part Three.</p>

<p>This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 8, and some challenges, which I have done, but should return to at least one of them for some refactoring.</p>
