I"¾<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 31 was: Project 5, part 3.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Have finished one challenge, but will leave the others until Iâ€™ve finished the course Iâ€™m currently on (one week to go).</p>
