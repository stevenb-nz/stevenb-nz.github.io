I"ª<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 73 was: Project 21, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 21, and some challenges. Still working on catching up on previous days, let alone previous daysâ€™ challenges.</p>
