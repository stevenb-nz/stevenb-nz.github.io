I"t<p>I went along to WellRailed on Thursday. First time Iâ€™ve been able to make it in quite a while. The first two talks were on security issues (one about timing attacks, the other about ImageTragick, both very interesting and useful). The third talk was about starting work as a developer for a bootcamp graduate, so quite relevant to me as an older career switcher.</p>
