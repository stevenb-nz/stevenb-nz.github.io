I"N<p>About a month ago, there was a post to the Quackle mailing list, reporting a bug as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When I put in a word that I do not have all the letters for, a dialog box comes up asking me if I want to play the word anyway.<br />
If I click the “no” button, it still plays the word anyway.</p>
