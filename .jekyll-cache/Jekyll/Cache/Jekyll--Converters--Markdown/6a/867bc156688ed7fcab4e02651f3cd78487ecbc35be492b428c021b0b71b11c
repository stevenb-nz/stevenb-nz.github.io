I"å<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 45 was: Project 11, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Falling boxes: SKSpriteNode, UITouch, SKPhysicsBody; and Bouncing balls: circleOfRadius.</p>

<p>Fun stuff. Would help to have an iPad of some kind to run stuff on, but no way I can afford that at the moment.</p>
