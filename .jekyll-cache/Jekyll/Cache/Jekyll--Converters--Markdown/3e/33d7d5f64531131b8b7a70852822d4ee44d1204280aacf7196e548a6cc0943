I"<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 80 was: Project 24, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Strings are not arrays; Working with strings in Swift; and Formatting strings with NSAttributedString.</p>

<p>I’ve wanted to use attributed strings in other settings, but didn’t chase it up at the time - nice to finally see how to do it.</p>
