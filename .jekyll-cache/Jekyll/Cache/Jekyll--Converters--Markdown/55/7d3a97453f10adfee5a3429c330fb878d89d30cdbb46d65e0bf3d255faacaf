I"Æ<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>Topic for Day 14 was: Swift review, day 2.</p>

<p>This involved reviewing the material on: Functions; Optionals; Optional chaining; Enumerations; Structs; and Classes.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m wondering what that leaves for the next two (supposedly also consolidation) days.</p>
