I"ª<p>Iâ€™ve started on adapting the DAG/DAWG (trie-based) data structure I used for my Scrabble analysis tool years ago, into a GADDAG. So, Iâ€™ve also been thinking about how Iâ€™ll need to change the move-generation algorithm to match.</p>

<p>I think the answer is to not change the overall strategy of generating all possible moves that include playing a tile on each particular anchor square, except those moves that would also place a tile on another anchor square above or to the left of the current one (as these moves will be generated when the current square is included in a move that starts at that other anchor square). How that works in practice remains to be seen.</p>
