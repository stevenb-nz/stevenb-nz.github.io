I"–<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 97 was: Project 30, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; What are we working with?; What can Instruments tell us?; Fixing the bugs: slow shadows; and Fixing the bugs: wasted allocations.</p>
