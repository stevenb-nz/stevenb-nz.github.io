I"<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 70 was: Project 20, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Ready… aim… fire: Timer and follow(); and Swipe to select.</p>

<p>Lots of iPad stuff - given that I’m wanting to focus on MacOS Apps, the last few game projects have been further removed from what I’m after than all the iPhone stuff.</p>
