I"¼<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 100 was: Final Exam.</p>

<p>This consisted of 100 questions, with 70 correct required for a pass, 80 for merit, or 95 for distinction. I managed 89, so closer to distinction than a bare pass, but not so close as to be an annoying miss!</p>
