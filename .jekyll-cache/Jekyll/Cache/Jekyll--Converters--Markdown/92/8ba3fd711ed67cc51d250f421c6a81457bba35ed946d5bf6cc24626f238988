I"É<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 55 was: Project 14, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Getting up and running: SKCropNode; and Penguin, show thyself: SKAction moveBy(x:y:duration:).</p>

<p>Would like to have taken this more slowly, but running short of time todayâ€¦</p>
