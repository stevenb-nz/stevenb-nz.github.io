I"¥<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as I‚Äôve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 47 was Milestone: Projects 7-9.</p>

<p>This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.</p>

<p>The challenge was to write a ‚Äúhabit-tracking‚Äù app. Will start on this the next time through.</p>
