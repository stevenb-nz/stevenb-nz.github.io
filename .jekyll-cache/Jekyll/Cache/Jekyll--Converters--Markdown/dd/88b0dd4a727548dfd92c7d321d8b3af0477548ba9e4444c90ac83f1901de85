I"ã<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 30 was: Project 6, Part One.</p>

<p>This included: Setting up; Advanced Auto Layout; and Auto Layout in code: addConstraints() with Visual Format Language.</p>

<p>Layout stuff today, so harder work for me to pay close attention to - Iâ€™m sure itâ€™ll sink in as I do more.</p>
