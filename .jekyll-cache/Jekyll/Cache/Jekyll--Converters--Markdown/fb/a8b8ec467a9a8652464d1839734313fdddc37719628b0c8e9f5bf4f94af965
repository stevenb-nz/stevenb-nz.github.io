I"B<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 92 was: Project 28, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; The basic text editor; Writing somewhere safe: the iOS keychain; and Touch to activate: Touch ID, Face ID and LocalAuthentication.</p>

<p>Again, good stuff to have looked at, so that I know where to refer back to if or when I need to do authentication with Touch ID, Face ID, and LocalAuthentication.</p>
