I"l<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 35 was Milestone: Projects 4-6.</p>

<p>This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.</p>

<p>The challenge was to write an “edutainment” app for practising multiplication tables. I have created a new SwiftUI app, but done no coding yet. Will need to go back and revisit some previous days before continuing with this. Will continue with subsequent days in the meantime.</p>
