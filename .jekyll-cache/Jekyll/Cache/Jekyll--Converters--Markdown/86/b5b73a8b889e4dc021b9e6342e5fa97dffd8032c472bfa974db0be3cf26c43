I"Ø<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 29 was: Project 5, Part Three.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and some challenges.</p>

<p>Havenâ€™t done the challenges yet, but had a solution for each of them in mind on first reading. We shall see if they were good solutions or not.</p>
