I"Û<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 43 was: Project 10, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Importing photos with UIImagePickerController; Custom subclasses of NSObject; and Connecting up the people.</p>

<p>Some useful stuff in there - will need to revisit it to get familiar enough with it to use it.</p>
