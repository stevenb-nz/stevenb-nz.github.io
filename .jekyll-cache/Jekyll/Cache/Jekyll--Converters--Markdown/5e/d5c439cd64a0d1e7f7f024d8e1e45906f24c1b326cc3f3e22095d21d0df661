I"—<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 52 was: Project 10, part 4.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Will proceed with getting caught up, then do the challenges when I go through again.</p>
