I"„<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 99 was: Milestone: Projects 28-30.</p>

<p>This consisted of a summary of what was learned and key points from those projects. And a challenge. Given that my preference is to work on MacOS projects, but decided that 100 Days of Swift would be relevant and motivating enough to be worth doing despite being focussed on iOS, Iâ€™m going to attempt this challenge on MacOS first and get back to the iOS version if and when I can fit it in.</p>
