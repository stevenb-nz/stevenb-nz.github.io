I"þ<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 12 was: Optionals.</p>

<p>This involved watching short videos on: Handling missing data; Unwrapping optionals; Unwrapping with guard; Force unwrapping; Implicitly unwrapped optionals; Nil coalescing; Optional chaining; Optional try; Failable initializers; Typecasting; and Optionals summary.</p>
