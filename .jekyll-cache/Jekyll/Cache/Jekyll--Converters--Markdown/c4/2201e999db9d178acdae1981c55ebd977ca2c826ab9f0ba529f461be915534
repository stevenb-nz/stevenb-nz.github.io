<h3 id="changes-to-the-ratings-system-in-2017-and-2019">changes to the ratings system in 2017 and 2019</h3>

<p>In 2015-16, I reviewed the 1999 ratings system, recommended changes, had these changes adopted, and implemented the new system for 2017. Here are: the two reports analysing the old system and recommending the new system; and a description of the calculations that are carried out in the new system.</p>

<p>In late 2018 / early 2019, a group of New Zealand Scrabble players, including myself, undertook the review of the 2017 changes that I recommended in my report above. Here is: our final report, which was adopted on 26/1/2019; and the code for the current implementation of both the 2017 and 2019 systems.</p>

<p>Anagrams, superstrings, substrings, supersets, subsets, â€˜Judgeâ€™ feature, Regular Expression search, â€˜Word Showâ€™ study aid, Quiz study aid, Mastermind-style word game, word patterns for basic cyphers, run user-supplied XojoScript against words in DB.</p>

<h3 id="old-tournament-scoring-program">old tournament scoring program</h3>

<p>There are two .dmgâ€™s available for download - T-Score 1.4.4 compiled for i) <a href="/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.4(PPC).dmg">PPC Macs</a> or ii) <a href="/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.4(Intel).dmg">Intel Macs</a>. The PPC version hasnâ€™t been tested as I no longer have easy access to a PPC-based machine (or even one running Rosetta).
This is the last update to the old version of T-Score - the old IDE no longer supports current machines.</p>

<h3 id="new-tournament-scoring-program">new tournament scoring program</h3>

<p>I have just started working on a Rails implementation of a tournament scoring program. Itâ€™s on <a href="https://github.com/stevenb-nz/nztscore">Github as nztscore</a>, but not much to see as of yet. This will probably go on the back burner now that there is a more urgent need for an updated Mac version (and a Windows version). (I.e. I will probably start work on an all-new version of the tournament scoring program using the current version of Xojo rather than Rails.)</p>
