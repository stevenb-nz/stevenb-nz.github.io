I"Ã<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 20 was: Project 2, part two.</p>

<p>This included: Guess which flag: random numbers; and From outlets to actions: creating an IBAction.</p>

<p>Learnt a couple more things about UIKit, still looking forward to the challenges for this project.</p>
