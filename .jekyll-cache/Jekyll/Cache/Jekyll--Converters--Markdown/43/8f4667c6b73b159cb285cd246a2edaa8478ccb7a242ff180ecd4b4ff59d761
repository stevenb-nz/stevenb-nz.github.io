I"`<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 51 was: Expanding your horizons.</p>

<p>This consisted of watching two videos: Elements of Functional Programming; and Teaching Swift at Scale.</p>
