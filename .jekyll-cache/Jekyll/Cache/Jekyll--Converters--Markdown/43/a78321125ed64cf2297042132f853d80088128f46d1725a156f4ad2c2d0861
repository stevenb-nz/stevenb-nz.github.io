I"°<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 82 was: Milestone: Projects 22-24.</p>

<p>This consisted of a summary of what was learned and key points from those projects. And some challenges, which I am looking forward to working on once Iâ€™m caught up to that point.</p>
