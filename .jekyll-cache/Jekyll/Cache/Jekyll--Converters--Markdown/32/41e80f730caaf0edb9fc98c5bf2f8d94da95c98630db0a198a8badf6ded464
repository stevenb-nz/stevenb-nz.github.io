I"ó<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 37 was: Project 8, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Loading a level and adding button targets; Itâ€™s play time: firstIndex(of:) and joined(); and Property observers: didSet.</p>

<p>Quite fun - starting to get distracted by how to use concepts in my own projects, so must be sinking in.</p>
