I"­<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 28 was: Project 4, part 3.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Have finished two challenges, but will need to leave the third until Iâ€™m back working with dual displays.</p>
