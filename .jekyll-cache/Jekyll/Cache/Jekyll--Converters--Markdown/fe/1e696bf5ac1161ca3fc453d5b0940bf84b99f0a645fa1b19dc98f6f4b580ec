I"¯<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 68 was: Project 19, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Establishing communication; Editing multiline text with UITextView; and Fixing the keyboard: NotificationCenter.</p>

<p>Some useful stuff to remember for the future.</p>
