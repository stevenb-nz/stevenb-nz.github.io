I"™<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>This involved watching short videos on: For loops; While loops; Repeat loops; Exiting loops; Exiting multiple loops; Skipping items; Infinite loops; and Looping summary.</p>
