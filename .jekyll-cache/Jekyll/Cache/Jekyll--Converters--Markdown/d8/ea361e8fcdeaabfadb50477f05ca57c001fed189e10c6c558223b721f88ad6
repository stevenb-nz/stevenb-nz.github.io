I"ÿ<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 67 was: Project 19, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Making a shell app; Adding an extension: NSExtensionItem; and What do you want to get?.</p>

<p>Will have to skim a bit to catch up, have had a few days doing other things. But should sort out Jekyllâ€™s daylight saving setting first.</p>
