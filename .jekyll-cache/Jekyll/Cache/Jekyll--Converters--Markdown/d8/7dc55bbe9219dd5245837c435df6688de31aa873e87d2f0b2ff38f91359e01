I"¶<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 6 was: Closures, part one.</p>

<p>This involved watching short videos on: Creating basic closures; Accepting parameters in a closure; Returning values from a closure; Closures as parameters; and Trailing closure syntax.</p>
