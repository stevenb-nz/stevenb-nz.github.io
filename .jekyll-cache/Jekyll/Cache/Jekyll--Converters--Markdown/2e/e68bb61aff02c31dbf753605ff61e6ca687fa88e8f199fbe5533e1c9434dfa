I"µ<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 72 was: Project 21, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Scheduling notifications: UNUserNotificationCenter and UNNotificationRequest; and Acting on responses.</p>

<p>Worth having gone through to refer back to later.</p>
