I"j<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>Topic for Day 6 was: Closures, Part 1.</p>

<p>I’m used to how Ruby does closures, so it’s going to take a little while for the Swift style and usage to really sink in.</p>
