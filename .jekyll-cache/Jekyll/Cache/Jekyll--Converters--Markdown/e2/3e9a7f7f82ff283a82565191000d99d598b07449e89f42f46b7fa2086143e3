I"¥<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 47 was: Project 11, Part Three.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Special effects: SKEmitterNode; a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 11; and some challenges. Have done two out of three of the challenges.</p>
