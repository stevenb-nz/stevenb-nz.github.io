I"Ý<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 31 was: Project 6, Part Two.</p>

<p>This included: Auto Layout metrics and priorities: constraints(withVisualFormat:); Auto Layout anchors; Wrap up; and Review for Project 6: Auto Layout.</p>

<p>Managed to figure out the challenges more easily than I thought I might.</p>
