I"ó<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 40 was: Project 9, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 9, and some challenges. Have caught up on some previous daysâ€™ challenges today (once I was satisfied I understood what was being asked for), will catch up on todayâ€™s in due course.</p>
