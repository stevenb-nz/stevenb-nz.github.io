I"à<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 22 was: Project 3.</p>

<p>Project 3 consisted of: About technique projects; UIActivityViewController explained; Wrap up; and Review for Project 3: Social media.</p>

<p>Still struggling with the challenges, but think Iâ€™ve learnt enough from the day so far to post this.</p>
