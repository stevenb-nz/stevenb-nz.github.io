I"À<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as I‚Äôve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 25 was Milestone: Projects 1-3.</p>

<p>This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.</p>

<p>The challenge was to write a ‚ÄúScissors, Paper, Stone‚Äù brain training app, which I have done to a very basic extent.</p>
