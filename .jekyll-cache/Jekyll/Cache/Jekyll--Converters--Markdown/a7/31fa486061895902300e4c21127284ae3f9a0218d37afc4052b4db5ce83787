I"ì<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 34 was: Project 7, Part Two.</p>

<p>This included: Rendering a petition: loadHTMLString; and Finishing touches: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.</p>

<p>Located the bit I missed yesterday, so it was all working again before I started on todayâ€™s stuff. Which I have now also finished.</p>
