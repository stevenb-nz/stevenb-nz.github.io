I"é<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 60 was Milestone: Projects 10-12.</p>

<p>This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.</p>

<p>The challenge was to write an app that downloads JSON data, converts it to Swift types, then displays it. Will start on this the next time through.</p>
