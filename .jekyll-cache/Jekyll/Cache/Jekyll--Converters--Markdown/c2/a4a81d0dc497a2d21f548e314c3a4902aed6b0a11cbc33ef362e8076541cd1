I"<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 83 was: Project 25, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Importing photos again; Going peer to peer: MCSession, MCBrowserViewController; and Invitation only: MCPeerID.</p>

<p>Nice to get two copies of the same program running at the same time (one in the simulator and one on the real phone) and talking to each other.</p>
