I"<p>While trying to get a gaddag working, it has ocurred to me that if <em>all</em> the permutations of prefix and suffix are included for each work, then the new sub-tree of the gaddag that has the pivot symbol as its root can be used the same way as a stand-alone dawg would be.</p>

<p>Currently, for example, the word CAT would be in the gaddag as C<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AT, AC</code>T, AND TAC<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">. The remaining possibility (</code>CAT) is not required for the finding of Scrabble plays, but if it is included, the tree with ` at its root is a DAWG of all the words in the gaddag, and can be used for simple yes/no - is-this-a-word? searches.</p>

<p>Also, if the gaddag is compressed by starting at all the leaf nodes, and combining identical endings working back up a level at a time (rather than starting from the root nodes, and combining the identical bits of the same length), the extra copy of all the words will be almost entirely compressed away.</p>
