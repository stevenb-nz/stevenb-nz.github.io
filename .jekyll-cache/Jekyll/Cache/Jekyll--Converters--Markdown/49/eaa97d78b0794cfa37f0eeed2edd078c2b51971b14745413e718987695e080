I"­<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 21 was: Project 2, part three.</p>

<p>This included: Wrap up; Review what you learned; and Challenge.</p>

<p>Thought the challenges for this project were actually simpler than at least the third challenge for Project 1.</p>
