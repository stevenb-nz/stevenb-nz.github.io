I"¼<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 33 was: Project 7, Part One.</p>

<p>This included: Setting up; Creating the basic UI: UITabBarController; and Parsing JSON using the Codable protocol.</p>

<p>Something is not working - I need to go back over it after a bit of a break.</p>
