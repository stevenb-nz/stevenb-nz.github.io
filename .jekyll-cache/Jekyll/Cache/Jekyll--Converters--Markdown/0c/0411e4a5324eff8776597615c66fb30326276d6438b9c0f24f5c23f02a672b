I"k<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>Topic for Day 8 was: Structs, Part 1.</p>

<p>Still catching up on tests… Lots of nice features in Swift structs though - looking forward to learning how best to use them.</p>
