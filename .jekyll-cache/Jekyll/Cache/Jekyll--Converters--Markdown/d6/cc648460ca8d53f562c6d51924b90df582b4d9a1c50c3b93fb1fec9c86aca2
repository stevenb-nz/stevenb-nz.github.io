I"Ò<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 42 was: Project 10, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Designing UICollectionView cells; and UICollectionView data sources.</p>

<p>Still trying to think of a real world app that uses this - there must be many, but nothing is springing to mind.</p>
