I"Ë<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 8 was: Structs, part one.</p>

<p>This involved watching short videos on: Creating your own structs; Computed properties; Property observers; Methods; Mutating methods; Properties and methods of strings; and Properties and methods of arrays.</p>
