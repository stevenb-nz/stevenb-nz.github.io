I"§<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 78 was: Time for MapKit.</p>

<p>This consisted of converting Day 77â€™s challenge to use MapKit. Again, will need to wait until Iâ€™ve caught up with the 100 days, then returned to each of the challenges.</p>
