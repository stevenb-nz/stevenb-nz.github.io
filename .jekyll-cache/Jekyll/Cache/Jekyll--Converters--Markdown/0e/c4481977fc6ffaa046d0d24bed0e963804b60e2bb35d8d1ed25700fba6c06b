I"È<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 60 was: Project 16, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Up and running with MapKit; and Annotations and accessory views: MKPinAnnotationView.</p>

<p>Fairly straightforward - but very tired today, so still took a while to work through.</p>
