I"‡<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 42 was: Project 8, part 4.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Will get to the challenges next time through (once Iâ€™ve caught up).</p>
