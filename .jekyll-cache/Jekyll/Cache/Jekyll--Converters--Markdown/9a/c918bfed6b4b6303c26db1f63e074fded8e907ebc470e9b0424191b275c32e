I"§<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 17 was: Project 1, part two.</p>

<p>This included: Building a detail screen; Loading images with UIImage; and Final tweaks: hidesBarsOnTap and large titles.</p>

<p>All good stuff; curious what tomorrow will bring.</p>
