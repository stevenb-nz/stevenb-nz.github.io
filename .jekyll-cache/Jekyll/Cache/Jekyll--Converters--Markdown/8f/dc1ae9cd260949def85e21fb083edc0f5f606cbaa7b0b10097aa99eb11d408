I"Â<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 34 was: Project 6, part 3.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Will leave the challenges until Iâ€™m home again with dual monitors. (One more day of the course, then kiwi.ruby.nz, then home.)</p>
