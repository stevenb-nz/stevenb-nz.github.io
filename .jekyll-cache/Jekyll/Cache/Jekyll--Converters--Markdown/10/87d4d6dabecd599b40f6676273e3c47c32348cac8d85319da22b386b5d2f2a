I"Í<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 26 was: Project 4, Part Three.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges.</p>

<p>Still catching up on the challenges for previous projects, but do seem to be starting to catch up now rather than falling further behind.</p>
