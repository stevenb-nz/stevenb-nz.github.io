I"Á<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 49 was: Project 12, Part Two.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Fixing Project 10: Codable; a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 12; and some challenges. The challenges will have to wait on catching up on previous daysâ€™ challenges.</p>
