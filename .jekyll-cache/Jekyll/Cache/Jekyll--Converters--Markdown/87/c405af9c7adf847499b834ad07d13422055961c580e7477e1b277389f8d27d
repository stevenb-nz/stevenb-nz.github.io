I"Ú<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 75 was: Project 22, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Requesting location: Core Location; and Hunting the beacon: CLBeaconRegion.</p>

<p>Only have the one iOS device, so wasnâ€™t able to test this beyond running on the iPhone. All seemed to run okay.</p>
