I"l<p>So, I’ve replaced my 3rd-gen Apple TV with a 5th-gen model. So far, I’ve mostly been trying (and mostly failing) to workaround differences between the two generations of software. At some point, I’ll move on to figuring out how to get something into the TVOS version of the App Store - there seems to still be some biggish gaps in what’s available.</p>
