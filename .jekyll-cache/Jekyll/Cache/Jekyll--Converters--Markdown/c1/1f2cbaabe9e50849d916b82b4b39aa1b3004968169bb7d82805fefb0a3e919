I" <p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>Topic for Day 11 was: protocols, extensions, and protocol extensions</p>

<p>Really getting into the good Swift stuff now - am really looking forward to thinking in terms of protocol-based programming becoming kind of natural.</p>
