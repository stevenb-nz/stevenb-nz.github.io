I"'<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>Topic for Day 13 was: Swift review, day 1.</p>

<p>This involved reviewing the material on: Variables and constants; Types of Data; Operators; String interpolation; Arrays; Dictionaries; Conditional statements; Loops; and Switch case.</p>

<p>I’m fairly happy with my understanding of all that - days 3 and 4 of the consolidation days will be the harder ones.</p>
