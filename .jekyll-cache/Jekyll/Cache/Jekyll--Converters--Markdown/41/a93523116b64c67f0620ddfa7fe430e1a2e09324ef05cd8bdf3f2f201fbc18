I"B<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 16 was: Project 1, part one.</p>

<p>This included: Setting up; Listing images with FileManager; and Designing our interface.</p>

<p>Looks like I misread the number of review days, and yesterday was the last of those. I’ve already worked through a MacOS version of this project as part of the Udemy course, which is good as the iOS differences are standing out to me.</p>
