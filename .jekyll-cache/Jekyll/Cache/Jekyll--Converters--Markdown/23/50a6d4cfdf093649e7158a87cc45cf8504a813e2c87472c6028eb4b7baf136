I"–<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 32 was: Milestone: Projects 4-6.</p>

<p>This consisted of a summary of what was learned and key points from those projects. And a challenge, which I have given some thought to, but not much action.</p>
