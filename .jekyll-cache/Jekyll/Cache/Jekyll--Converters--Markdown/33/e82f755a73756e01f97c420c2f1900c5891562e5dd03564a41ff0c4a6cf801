I"Ù<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 26 was: Project 4, part 1.</p>

<p>This included: BetterRest: Introduction; Entering numbers with Stepper; Selecting dates and times with DatePicker; Working with dates; and Training a model with Create ML.</p>

<p>Interesting to have a go with Create ML.</p>
