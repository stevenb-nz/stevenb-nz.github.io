I"ß<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 19 was: Project 2, part one.</p>

<p>This included: Setting up; Designing your layout; and Making the basic game work: UIButton and CALayer.</p>

<p>Learnt a few more things about UIKit, looking forward to the challenges for this project (in a couple of days presumably).</p>
