I"S<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 23 was: Project 3, part one.</p>

<p>This included: Views and modifiers: Introduction; Why does SwiftUI use structs for views?; What is behind the main SwiftUI view?; Why modifier order matters; Why does SwiftUI use “some View” for its view type?; Conditional modifiers; Environment modifiers; Views as properties; View composition; Custom modifiers; and Custom containers.</p>
