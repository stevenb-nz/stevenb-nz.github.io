I"õ<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 28 was: Project 5, Part Two.</p>

<p>This included: Prepare for submission: lowercased() and IndexPath; Checking for valid answers; and Or else what?.</p>

<p>Todayâ€™s code was more in one of my sweet spots (i.e. dealing with words, strings, and combinations), so seemed to go quite smoothly.</p>
