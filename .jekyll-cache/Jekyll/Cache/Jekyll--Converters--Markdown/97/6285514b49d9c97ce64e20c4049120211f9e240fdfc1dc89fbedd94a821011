I"œ<p>I have just finished Day 1 of <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>.</p>

<p>The first 15 days will be repeating the beginning of the <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a> that I completed in the first half of the year, but figure I may as well go through them as a very quick refresher, and to fulfil the daily posting requirement.</p>
