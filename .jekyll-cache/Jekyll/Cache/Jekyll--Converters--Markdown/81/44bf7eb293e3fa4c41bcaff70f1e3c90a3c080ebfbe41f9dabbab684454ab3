I"<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 39 was: Project 9, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; Why is locking the UI bad?; GCD 101: async(); Back to the main thread: DispatchQueue.main; and Easy GCD using performSelector(inBackground:).</p>

<p>Grand Central Dispatch - well explained, followed it better than the previous time I watched something about it.</p>
