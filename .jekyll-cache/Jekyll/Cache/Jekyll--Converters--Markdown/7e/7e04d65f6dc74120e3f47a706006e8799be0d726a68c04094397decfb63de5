I"õ<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it. Didnâ€™t manage to do that the same day this time (fell asleep too early in the evening).</p>

<p>Topic for Day 10 was: classes and inheritance</p>

<p>Once nice feature (that I hadnâ€™t noticed in Swift before) is the requirement to use the â€˜overrideâ€™ keyword whenever overriding a superclass method in a subclass.</p>
