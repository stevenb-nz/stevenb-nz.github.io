I"ä<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 36 was: Project 8, Part One.</p>

<p>This consisted of: Setting up; and Building a UIKit user interface programmatically (the video for this second part was over half an hour long).</p>

<p>Useful stuff to refer back to when I need or want to do things this way in the future.</p>
