I"¬<p>In iTunes, I have set up a group of playlists which let me manually batch-process my library. Thereâ€™s one smart playlist, which is the source of each batch (a random selection of tracks that I havenâ€™t marked as â€˜doneâ€™ yet (by copying them to the done playlist)), and two ordinary playlists, one of which is a copy of the current contents of the source playlist, and the other of which is the â€˜doneâ€™ playlist.</p>
