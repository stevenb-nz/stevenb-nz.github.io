I"l<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, as soon as I’ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 24 was: Project 3, part two.</p>

<p>This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Managed to achieve all three challenges.</p>
