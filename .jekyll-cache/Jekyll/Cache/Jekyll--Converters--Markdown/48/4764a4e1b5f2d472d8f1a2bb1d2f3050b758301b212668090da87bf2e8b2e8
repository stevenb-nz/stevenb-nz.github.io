I"ë<p>According to the rules for taking part in <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100">100 Days of Swift</a>, as soon as Iâ€™ve finished each day, I have to post about it.</p>

<p>The topic for Day 44 was: Project 10, Part Three.</p>

<p>This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 10, and some challenges. Still working on catching up on previous daysâ€™ challenges - will hopefully make better progress once tomorrowâ€™s procedure is over and done with.</p>
