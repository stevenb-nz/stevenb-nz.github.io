### EDA final project (Rails)

\[ link to come \]

### Advent of Code (Ruby)

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) was a series of code challenges (two related challenges each day) released each day of December through to Christmas 2015. I caught up with it after the fact in January, and got through to Day 12 ([rough solutions on GitHub](https://github.com/stevenb-nz/AdventOfCode)). If and when I get back to focussing on Ruby, I'm intending to do rough solutions to the remaining days, then go back through adding tests, and then refactoring.

### trial Electron project

\[ to come \]

### Ember front-end to Phoenix (Elixir) back-end?

\[ in due course, time permitting \]
