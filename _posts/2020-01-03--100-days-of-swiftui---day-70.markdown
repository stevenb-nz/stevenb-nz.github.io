According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 70 was: Project 14, part 3.

This included: Advanced MKMapView with SwiftUI; and Customizing MKMapView annotations.
