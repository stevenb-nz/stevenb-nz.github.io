According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 28 was: Project 4, part 3.

This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Have finished two challenges, but will need to leave the third until I'm back working with dual displays.
