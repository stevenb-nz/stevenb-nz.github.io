According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

Topic for Day 13 was: Swift review, day 1.

This involved reviewing the material on: Variables and constants; Types of Data; Operators; String interpolation; Arrays; Dictionaries; Conditional statements; Loops; and Switch case.

I'm fairly happy with my understanding of all that - days 3 and 4 of the consolidation days will be the harder ones.
