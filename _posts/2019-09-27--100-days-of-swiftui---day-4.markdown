According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 4 was: Loops.

This involved watching short videos on: For loops; While loops; Repeat loops; Exiting loops; Exiting multiple loops; Skipping items; Infinite loops; and Looping summary.
