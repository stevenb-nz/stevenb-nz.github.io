I have just finished Day 1 of [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100).

The first day covered variables, simple data types, and string interpolation. So, nothing of note as of yet, but the two requirements for taking part are to spend time on it every day, and to post your progress each day. So, this is fulfilling the second of those for Day 1.
