According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 17 was: Project 1, part two.

This included: Reading text from the user with TextField; Creating pickers in a form; Adding a segmented control for tip percentages; and Calculating the total per person.
