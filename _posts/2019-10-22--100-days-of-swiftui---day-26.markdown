According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 26 was: Project 4, part 1.

This included: BetterRest: Introduction; Entering numbers with Stepper; Selecting dates and times with DatePicker; Working with dates; and Training a model with Create ML.

Interesting to have a go with Create ML.
