According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 37 was: Project 8, Part Two.

This consisted of: Loading a level and adding button targets; It's play time: firstIndex(of:) and joined(); and Property observers: didSet.

Quite fun - starting to get distracted by how to use concepts in my own projects, so must be sinking in.
