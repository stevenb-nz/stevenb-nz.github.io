According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 50 was: Project 10, part 2.

This included: Taking basic order details; Checking for a valid address; and Preparing for checkout.
