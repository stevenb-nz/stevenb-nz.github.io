According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 59 was: Milestone: Projects 13-15.

This consisted of a summary of what was learned and key points from those projects. And a challenge, which I will get to once I have caught up on previous challenges (including the previous milestone...).
