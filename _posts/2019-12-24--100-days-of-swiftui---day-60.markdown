According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 60 was Milestone: Projects 10-12.

This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.

The challenge was to write an app that downloads JSON data, converts it to Swift types, then displays it. Will start on this the next time through.
