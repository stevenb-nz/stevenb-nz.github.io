According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 15 was: Swift review, day three.

This involved reviewing these topics: Properties; Static properties and methods; Access control; Polymorphism and typecasting; and Closures.
