According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 9 was: Structs, part two.

This involved watching short videos on: Initializers; Referring to the current instance; Lazy properties; Static properties and methods; Access control; and Structs summary.
