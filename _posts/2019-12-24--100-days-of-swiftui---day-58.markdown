According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 58 was: Project 12, part 2.

This included: Filtering @FetchRequest using NSPredicate; Dynamically filtering @FetchRequest with SwiftUI; and One-to-many relationships with Core Data, SwiftUI, and @FetchRequest.
