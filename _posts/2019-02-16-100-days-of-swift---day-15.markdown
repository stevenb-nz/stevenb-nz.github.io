According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

Topic for Day 15 was: Swift review, day 3.

This involved reviewing the material on: Properties; Static properties and methods; Access control; Polymorphism and typecasting; and Closures.
