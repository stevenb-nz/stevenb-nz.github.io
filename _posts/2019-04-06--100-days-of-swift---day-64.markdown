According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 64 was: Project 18, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Basic Swift debugging using print(); Debugging with assert(); Debugging with breakpoints; and View debugging.

Looks like XCode has some pretty decent debugging tools. Will have to see how easy and/or useful they are in practice.
