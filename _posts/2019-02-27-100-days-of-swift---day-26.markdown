According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 26 was: Project 4, Part Three.

This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges.

Still catching up on the challenges for previous projects, but do seem to be starting to catch up now rather than falling further behind.
