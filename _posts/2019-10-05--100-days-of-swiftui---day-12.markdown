According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 12 was: Optionals.

This involved watching short videos on: Handling missing data; Unwrapping optionals; Unwrapping with guard; Force unwrapping; Implicitly unwrapped optionals; Nil coalescing; Optional chaining; Optional try; Failable initializers; Typecasting; and Optionals summary.
