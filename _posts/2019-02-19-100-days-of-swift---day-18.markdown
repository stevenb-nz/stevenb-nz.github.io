According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 18 was: Project 1, part three.

This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Managed to achieve all three challenges in about 15-20 minutes, so I seem to be learning something.
