According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 37 was: Project 7,part 2.

This included: Building a list we can delete from; Working with Identifiable items in SwiftUI; Sharing an observed object with a new view; Making changes permanent with UserDefaults; and Final polish.
