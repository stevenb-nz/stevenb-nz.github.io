According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

Topic for Day 14 was: Swift review, day 2.

This involved reviewing the material on: Functions; Optionals; Optional chaining; Enumerations; Structs; and Classes.

I'm wondering what that leaves for the next two (supposedly also consolidation) days.
