According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 57 was: Project 15, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Preparing for action; Switch, case, animate: animate(withDuration:); and Transform: CGAffineTransform.

Good animation stuff. Just about asleep though, so not sure how much I'll remember.
