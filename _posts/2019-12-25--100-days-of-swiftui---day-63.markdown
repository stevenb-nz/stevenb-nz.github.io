According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 63 was: Project 13, part 2.

This included: Integrating Core Image with SwiftUI; and Wrapping a UIViewController in a SwiftUI view.
