According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 33 was: Project 6, part 2.

This included: Controlling the animation stack; Animating gestures; Showing and hiding views with transitions; and Building custom transitions using ViewModifier.
