According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 78 was: Project 23, Part Two.

This consisted of: Follow the sequence; Slice to win; and Game over, man: SKTexture.

Nice to recognise things from previous days, with them now making more sense. Game seems a bit unfinished, but suspect this will be one of the next day's challenges.
