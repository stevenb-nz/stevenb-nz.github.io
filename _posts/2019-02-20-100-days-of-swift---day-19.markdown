According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 19 was: Project 2, part one.

This included: Setting up; Designing your layout; and Making the basic game work: UIButton and CALayer.

Learnt a few more things about UIKit, looking forward to the challenges for this project (in a couple of days presumably).
