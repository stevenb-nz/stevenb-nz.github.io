According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 75 was: Project 22, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Requesting location: Core Location; and Hunting the beacon: CLBeaconRegion.

Only have the one iOS device, so wasn't able to test this beyond running on the iPhone. All seemed to run okay.
