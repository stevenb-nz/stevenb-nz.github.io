According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 17 was: Project 1, part two.

This included: Building a detail screen; Loading images with UIImage; and Final tweaks: hidesBarsOnTap and large titles.

All good stuff; curious what tomorrow will bring.
