According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 2 was: Complex data types.

This involved watching short videos on: Arrays; Sets; Tuples; Arrays vs sets vs tuples; Dictionaries; Dictionary default values; Creating empty collections; Enumerations; Enum associated values; Enum raw values; and Complex types: Summary.
