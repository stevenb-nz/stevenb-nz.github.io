According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 45 was: Project 9, part 3.

This included: Special effects in SwiftUI: blurs, blending, and more; Animating simple shapes with animatableData; Animating complex shapes with AnimatablePair; and Creating a spirograph with SwiftUI.
