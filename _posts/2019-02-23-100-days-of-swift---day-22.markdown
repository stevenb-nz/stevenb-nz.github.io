According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 22 was: Project 3.

Project 3 consisted of: About technique projects; UIActivityViewController explained; Wrap up; and Review for Project 3: Social media.

Still struggling with the challenges, but think I've learnt enough from the day so far to post this.
