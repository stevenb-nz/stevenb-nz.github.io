According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 61 was: Time for Core Data.

This consisted of converting Day 60's challenge to use Core Data. Again, will need to wait until I've caught up with the 100 days, then returned to each of the challenges.
