According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 30 was: Project 6, Part One.

This included: Setting up; Advanced Auto Layout; and Auto Layout in code: addConstraints() with Visual Format Language.

Layout stuff today, so harder work for me to pay close attention to - I'm sure it'll sink in as I do more.
