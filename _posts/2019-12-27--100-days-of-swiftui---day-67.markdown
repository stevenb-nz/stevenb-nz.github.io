According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 67 was: Project 13, part 6.

This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Will get back to the challenges once I've caught up on the days.
