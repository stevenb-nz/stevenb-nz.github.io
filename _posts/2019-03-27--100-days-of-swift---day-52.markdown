According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 52 was: Project 13, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Designing the interface; and Importing a picture.

Stuff like using suggested constraints under resolving Auto Layout settings seem to be much clearer here than in previous courses I've looked at. Not sure if that's because I have now seen it before, or if Paul Hudson is better at presenting and explaining the material.
