According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 30 was: Project 5, part 2.

This included: Adding to a list of words; Running code when our app launches; and Validating words with UITextChecker.
