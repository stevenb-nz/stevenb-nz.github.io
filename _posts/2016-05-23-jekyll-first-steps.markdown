Back in January I got Jekyll set up to the point of changing the link to Twitter in the model I was working from to one to LinkedIn, and getting that link to display my name rather than my full name from LinkedIn (which was too long to display nicely). This involved splitting out a new variable in Jekyll, and generally tidying up the differences between the base code I was modifying, and the example of adding an svg image for the LinkedIn icon.

Now, after some time working on other projects, I'm back to try adding a post (this one).

Next, I'll be adding a few static pages.
