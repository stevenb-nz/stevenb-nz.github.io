According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 63 was: Project 17, Part Two.

This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 17, and some challenges. Still working on catching up on previous days' challenges.
