According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 27 was: Project 5, Part One.

This included: Capture lists in Swift: whatâ€™s the difference between weak, strong, and unowned references?; Setting up; Reading from disk: contentsOfFile; and Pick a word, any word: UIAlertController.

Not feeling very well today - this all seems a bit fuzzy at the moment, but hopefully something is sinking in.
