According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 46 was: Project 11, Part Two.

This consisted of: Spinning slots: SKAction; Collision detection: SKPhysicsContactDelegate; and Scores on the board: SKLabelNode.

Very interesting SpriteKit stuff. Trying hard not to get too distracted by wondering how different SpriteKit is in desktop (MacOS) apps, or by how I could make use of Xojo's implementation of property observers.
