According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 39 was: Project 9, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Why is locking the UI bad?; GCD 101: async(); Back to the main thread: DispatchQueue.main; and Easy GCD using performSelector(inBackground:).

Grand Central Dispatch - well explained, followed it better than the previous time I watched something about it.
