According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 60 was: Project 16, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Up and running with MapKit; and Annotations and accessory views: MKPinAnnotationView.

Fairly straightforward - but very tired today, so still took a while to work through.
