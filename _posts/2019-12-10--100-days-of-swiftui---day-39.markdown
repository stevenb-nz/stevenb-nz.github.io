According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 39 was: Project 8, part 1.

This included: Moonshot: Introduction; Resizing images to fit the screen using GeometryReader; How ScrollView lets us work with scrolling data; Pushing new views onto the stack using NavigationLink; and Working with hierarchical Codable data.
