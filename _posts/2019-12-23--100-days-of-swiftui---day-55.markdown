According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 55 was: Project 11, part 3.

This included: Showing book details; Sorting fetch requests with NSSortDescriptor; Deleting from a Core Data fetch request; and Using an alert to pop a NavigationLink programmatically.
