According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 51 was: Project 10, part 3.

This included: Encoding an ObservableObject class; and Sending and receiving orders over the internet.
