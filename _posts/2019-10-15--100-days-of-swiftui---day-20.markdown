According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 20 was: Project 2, part one.

This included: Guess the Flag: Introduction; Using stacks to arrange views; Colors and frames; Gradients; Buttons and images; and Showing alert messages.
