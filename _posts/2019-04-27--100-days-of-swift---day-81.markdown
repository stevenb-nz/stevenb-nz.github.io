According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 81 was: Project 24, Part Two.

This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 24, and some challenges.

The challenges are all String extensions - looking forward to working on them once I'm caught up to that point.
