The clocks went forward overnight, and I've remembered to change the settings for sublime-jekyll to match (i.e. changing the time-zone offset from +1200 to +1300). I'm creating and posting this blog post to test if this works.

And yes, it works.

[Edit] Actually, may as well leave it this way now - once the clocks go back again, the summertime correction will line local now up with one hour before server now, so the post would appear immediately. (Whereas, if I left the correction as for standard time while it is currently summertime, the post appearing would be delayed an hour, as local now would be lined up to an hour in the server time's future.)
