According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 24 was: Project 4, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Creating a simple browser with WKWebView; and Choosing a website: UIAlertController action sheets.

After tomorrow, that's a quarter of the way through...
