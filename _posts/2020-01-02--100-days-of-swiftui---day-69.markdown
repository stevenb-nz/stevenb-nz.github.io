According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 69 was: Project 14, part 2.

This included: Integrating MapKit with SwiftUI; Communicating with a MapKit coordinator; and Using Touch ID and Face ID with SwiftUI.
