According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 16 was: Project 1, part one.

This included: WeSplit: Introduction; Understanding the basic structure of a SwiftUI app; Creating a form; Adding a navigation bar; Modifying program state; Binding state to user interface controls; and Creating views in a loop.
