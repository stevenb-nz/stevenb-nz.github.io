According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 67 was: Project 19, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Making a shell app; Adding an extension: NSExtensionItem; and What do you want to get?.

Will have to skim a bit to catch up, have had a few days doing other things. But should sort out Jekyll's daylight saving setting first.
