According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 62 was: Project 13, part 1.

This included: Instafilter: Introduction; How property wrappers become structs; Creating custom bindings in SwiftUI; and Showing multiple options with ActionSheet.
