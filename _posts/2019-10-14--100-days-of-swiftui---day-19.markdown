According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 19 was Challenge day. The challenge was to write your own SwiftUI App, to do conversions between different units for a particular physical quantity. I chose temperature, with Celcius as the canonical unit between Fahrenheit and Kelvin.
