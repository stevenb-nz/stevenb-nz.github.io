According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 85 was: Project 26, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; and Loading a level: categoryBitMask, collisionBitMask, contactTestBitMask.
