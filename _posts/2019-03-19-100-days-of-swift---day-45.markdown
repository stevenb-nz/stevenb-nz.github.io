According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 45 was: Project 11, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Falling boxes: SKSpriteNode, UITouch, SKPhysicsBody; and Bouncing balls: circleOfRadius.

Fun stuff. Would help to have an iPad of some kind to run stuff on, but no way I can afford that at the moment.
