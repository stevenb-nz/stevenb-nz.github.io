According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 22 was: Project 2, part three.

This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Managed to achieve all three challenges in about 15-20 minutes, so I still seem to be learning something.

Question: why does SwiftUI render (for example): Text("Tap the flag of")
as: Tap the flag...
but renders: Text("Tap the flag of ")
as: Tap the flag of
?
