According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 5 was: Functions.

This involved watching short videos on: Writing functions; Accepting parameters; Returning values; Parameter labels; Omitting parameter labels; Default parameters; Variadic functions; Writing throwing functions; Running throwing functions; inout parameters; and Functions summary.
