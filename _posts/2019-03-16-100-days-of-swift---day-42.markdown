According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 42 was: Project 10, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Designing UICollectionView cells; and UICollectionView data sources.

Still trying to think of a real world app that uses this - there must be many, but nothing is springing to mind.
