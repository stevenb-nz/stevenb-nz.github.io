According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 53 was: Project 13, Part Two.

This consisted of: Applying filters: CIContext, CIFilter; and Saving to the iOS photo library.
