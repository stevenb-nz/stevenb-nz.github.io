According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 48 was: Expanding your horizons.

This consisted of watching a video: What Star Wars Can Teach Us About Swift.
