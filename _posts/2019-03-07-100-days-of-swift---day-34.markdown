According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 34 was: Project 7, Part Two.

This included: Rendering a petition: loadHTMLString; and Finishing touches: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions.

Located the bit I missed yesterday, so it was all working again before I started on today's stuff. Which I have now also finished.
