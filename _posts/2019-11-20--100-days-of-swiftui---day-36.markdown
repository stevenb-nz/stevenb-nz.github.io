According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 36 was: Project 7,part 1.

This included: iExpense: Introduction; Why @State only works with structs; Sharing SwiftUI state with @ObservedObject; Showing and hiding views; Deleting items using onDelete(); Storing user settings with UserDefaults; and Archiving Swift objects with Codable.
