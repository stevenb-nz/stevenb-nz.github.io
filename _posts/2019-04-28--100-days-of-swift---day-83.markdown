According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 83 was: Project 25, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Importing photos again; Going peer to peer: MCSession, MCBrowserViewController; and Invitation only: MCPeerID.

Nice to get two copies of the same program running at the same time (one in the simulator and one on the real phone) and talking to each other.
