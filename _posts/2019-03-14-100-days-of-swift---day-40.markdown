According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 40 was: Project 9, Part Two.

This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 9, and some challenges. Have caught up on some previous days' challenges today (once I was satisfied I understood what was being asked for), will catch up on today's in due course.
