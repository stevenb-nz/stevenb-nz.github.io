According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 3 was: Operators and conditions.

This involved watching short videos on: Arithmetic Operators; Operator overloading; Compound assignment operators; Comparison operators; Conditions; Combining conditions; The ternary operator; Switch statements; Range operators; and Operators and conditions summary.
