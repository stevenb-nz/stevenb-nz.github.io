According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 43 was: Project 9, part 1.

This included: Drawing: Introduction; Creating custom paths with SwiftUI; Paths vs shapes in SwiftUI; and Adding strokeBorder() support with InsettableShape.
