According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 29 was: Project 5, part 1.

This included: Word Scramble: Introduction; Introducing List, your best friend; Loading resources from your app bundle; and Working with strings.
