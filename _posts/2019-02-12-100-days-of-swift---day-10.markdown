According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it. Didn't manage to do that the same day this time (fell asleep too early in the evening).

Topic for Day 10 was: classes and inheritance

Once nice feature (that I hadn't noticed in Swift before) is the requirement to use the 'override' keyword whenever overriding a superclass method in a subclass.
