According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 71 was: Project 20, Part Two.

This consisted of: Making things go bang: SKEmitterNode; a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 20; and some challenges. As per usual, the challenges will have to wait on catching up on previous days' challenges.
