According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

Topic for Day 8 was: Structs, Part 1.

Still catching up on tests... Lots of nice features in Swift structs though - looking forward to learning how best to use them.
