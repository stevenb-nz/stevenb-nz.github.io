According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

Topic for Day 11 was: protocols, extensions, and protocol extensions

Really getting into the good Swift stuff now - am really looking forward to thinking in terms of protocol-based programming becoming kind of natural.
