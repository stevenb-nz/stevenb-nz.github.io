According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 11 was: Protocols and extensions.

This involved watching short videos on: Protocols; Protocol inheritance; Extensions; Protocol extensions; Protocol-oriented programming; and Protocols and extensions summary.
