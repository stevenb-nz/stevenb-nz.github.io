According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 92 was: Project 28, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; The basic text editor; Writing somewhere safe: the iOS keychain; and Touch to activate: Touch ID, Face ID and LocalAuthentication.

Again, good stuff to have looked at, so that I know where to refer back to if or when I need to do authentication with Touch ID, Face ID, and LocalAuthentication.
