According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 48 was: Project 12, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Reading and writing basics: UserDefaults; and Fixing Project 10: NSCoding.

Very useful data persistence stuff. Looking forward to the next day.
