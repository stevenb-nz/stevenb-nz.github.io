According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 72 was: Project 14, part 5.

This included: Making someone elseâ€™s class conform to Codable; and Locking our UI behind Face ID.
