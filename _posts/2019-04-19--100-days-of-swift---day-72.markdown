According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 72 was: Project 21, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Scheduling notifications: UNUserNotificationCenter and UNNotificationRequest; and Acting on responses.

Worth having gone through to refer back to later.
