According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 68 was: Project 19, Part Two.

This consisted of: Establishing communication; Editing multiline text with UITextView; and Fixing the keyboard: NotificationCenter.

Some useful stuff to remember for the future.
