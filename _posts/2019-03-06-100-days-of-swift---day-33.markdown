According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 33 was: Project 7, Part One.

This included: Setting up; Creating the basic UI: UITabBarController; and Parsing JSON using the Codable protocol.

Something is not working - I need to go back over it after a bit of a break.
