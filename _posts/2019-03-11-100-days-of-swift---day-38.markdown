According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 38 was: Project 8, Part Three.

This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 8, and some challenges, which I have done, but should return to at least one of them for some refactoring.
