According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 23 was: Project 3, part one.

This included: Views and modifiers: Introduction; Why does SwiftUI use structs for views?; What is behind the main SwiftUI view?; Why modifier order matters; Why does SwiftUI use “some View” for its view type?; Conditional modifiers; Environment modifiers; Views as properties; View composition; Custom modifiers; and Custom containers.
