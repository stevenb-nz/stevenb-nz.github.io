According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 34 was: Project 6, part 3.

This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and 3 challenges. Will leave the challenges until I'm home again with dual monitors. (One more day of the course, then kiwi.ruby.nz, then home.)
