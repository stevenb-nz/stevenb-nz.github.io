According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 6 was: Closures, part one.

This involved watching short videos on: Creating basic closures; Accepting parameters in a closure; Returning values from a closure; Closures as parameters; and Trailing closure syntax.
