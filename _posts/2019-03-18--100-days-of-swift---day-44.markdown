According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 44 was: Project 10, Part Three.

This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 10, and some challenges. Still working on catching up on previous days' challenges - will hopefully make better progress once tomorrow's procedure is over and done with.
