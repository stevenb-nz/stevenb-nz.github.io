According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 80 was: Project 24, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Strings are not arrays; Working with strings in Swift; and Formatting strings with NSAttributedString.

I've wanted to use attributed strings in other settings, but didn't chase it up at the time - nice to finally see how to do it.
