According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 64 was: Project 13, part 3.

This included: Using coordinators to manage SwiftUI view controllers; and How to save images to the userâ€™s photo library.
