According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 44 was: Project 9, part 2.

This included: Transforming shapes using CGAffineTransform and even-odd fills; Creative borders and fills using ImagePaint; and Enabling high-performance Metal rendering with drawingGroup().
