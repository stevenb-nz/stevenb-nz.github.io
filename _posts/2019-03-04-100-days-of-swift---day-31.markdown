According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 31 was: Project 6, Part Two.

This included: Auto Layout metrics and priorities: constraints(withVisualFormat:); Auto Layout anchors; Wrap up; and Review for Project 6: Auto Layout.

Managed to figure out the challenges more easily than I thought I might.
