According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 65 was: Project 13, part 4.

This included: Building our basic UI; Importing an image into SwiftUI using UIImagePickerController; and Basic image filtering using Core Image.
