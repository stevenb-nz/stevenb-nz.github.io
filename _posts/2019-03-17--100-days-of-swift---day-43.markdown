According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 43 was: Project 10, Part Two.

This consisted of: Importing photos with UIImagePickerController; Custom subclasses of NSObject; and Connecting up the people.

Some useful stuff in there - will need to revisit it to get familiar enough with it to use it.
