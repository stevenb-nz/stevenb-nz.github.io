According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 78 was: Time for MapKit.

This consisted of converting Day 77's challenge to use MapKit. Again, will need to wait until I've caught up with the 100 days, then returned to each of the challenges.
