According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 49 was: Project 12, Part Two.

This consisted of: Fixing Project 10: Codable; a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 12; and some challenges. The challenges will have to wait on catching up on previous days' challenges.
