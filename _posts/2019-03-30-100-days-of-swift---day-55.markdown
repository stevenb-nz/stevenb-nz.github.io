According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 55 was: Project 14, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Getting up and running: SKCropNode; and Penguin, show thyself: SKAction moveBy(x:y:duration:).

Would like to have taken this more slowly, but running short of time today...
