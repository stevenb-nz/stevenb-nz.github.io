According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 21 was: Project 2, part three.

This included: Wrap up; Review what you learned; and Challenge.

Thought the challenges for this project were actually simpler than at least the third challenge for Project 1.
