According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 20 was: Project 2, part two.

This included: Guess which flag: random numbers; and From outlets to actions: creating an IBAction.

Learnt a couple more things about UIKit, still looking forward to the challenges for this project.
