According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 47 was: Project 11, Part Three.

This consisted of: Special effects: SKEmitterNode; a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 11; and some challenges. Have done two out of three of the challenges.
