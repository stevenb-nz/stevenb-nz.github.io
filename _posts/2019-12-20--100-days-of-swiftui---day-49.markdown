According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 49 was: Project 10, part 1.

This included: Cupcake Corner: Introduction; Adding Codable conformance for @Published properties; Sending and receiving Codable data with URLSession and SwiftUI; and Validating and disabling forms.
