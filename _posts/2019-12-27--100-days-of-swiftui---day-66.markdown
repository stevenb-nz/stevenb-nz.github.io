According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 66 was: Project 13, part 5.

This included: Customizing our filter using ActionSheet; and Saving the filtered image using UIImageWriteToSavedPhotosAlbum().
