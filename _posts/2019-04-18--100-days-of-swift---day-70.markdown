According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 70 was: Project 20, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Ready... aim... fire: Timer and follow(); and Swipe to select.

Lots of iPad stuff - given that I'm wanting to focus on MacOS Apps, the last few game projects have been further removed from what I'm after than all the iPhone stuff.
