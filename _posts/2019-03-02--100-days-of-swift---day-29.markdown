According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 29 was: Project 5, Part Three.

This included a project wrap-up, a project review, and some challenges.

Haven't done the challenges yet, but had a solution for each of them in mind on first reading. We shall see if they were good solutions or not.
