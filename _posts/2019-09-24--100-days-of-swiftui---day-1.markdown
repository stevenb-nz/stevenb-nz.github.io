I have just finished Day 1 of [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui).

The first 15 days will be repeating the beginning of the [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100) that I completed in the first half of the year, but figure I may as well go through them as a very quick refresher, and to fulfil the daily posting requirement.
