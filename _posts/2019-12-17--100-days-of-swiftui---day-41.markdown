According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 41 was: Project 8, part 3.

This included: Showing mission details with ScrollView and GeometryReader; Merging Codable structs using first(where:); and Fixing problems with buttonStyle() and layoutPriority().
