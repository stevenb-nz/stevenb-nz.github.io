According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 90 was: Milestone: Projects 25-27.

This consisted of a summary of what was learned and key points from those projects. And a challenge, which I will work on once I'm caught up to that point.
