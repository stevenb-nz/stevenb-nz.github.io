According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 56 was: Project 14, Part Two.

This consisted of: Whack to win: SKAction sequences; a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 14; and some challenges. As per usual, the challenges will have to wait on catching up on previous days' challenges.
