According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 40 was: Project 8, part 2.

This included: Loading a specific kind of Codable data; Using generics to load any kind of Codable data; and Formatting our mission view.
