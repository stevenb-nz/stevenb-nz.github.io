According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 27 was: Project 4, part 2.

This included: Building a basic layout; Connecting SwiftUI to Core ML; and Cleaning up the user interface.
