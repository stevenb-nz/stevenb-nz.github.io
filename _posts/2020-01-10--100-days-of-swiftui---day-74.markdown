According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 74 was: Project 15, part 1.

This included: Accessibility: Introduction; Identifying views with useful labels; Hiding and grouping accessibility data; and Reading the value of controls.
