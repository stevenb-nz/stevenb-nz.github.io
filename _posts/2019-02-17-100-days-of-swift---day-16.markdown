According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 16 was: Project 1, part one.

This included: Setting up; Listing images with FileManager; and Designing our interface.

Looks like I misread the number of review days, and yesterday was the last of those. I've already worked through a MacOS version of this project as part of the Udemy course, which is good as the iOS differences are standing out to me.
