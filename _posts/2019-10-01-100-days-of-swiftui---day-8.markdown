According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 8 was: Structs, part one.

This involved watching short videos on: Creating your own structs; Computed properties; Property observers; Methods; Mutating methods; Properties and methods of strings; and Properties and methods of arrays.
