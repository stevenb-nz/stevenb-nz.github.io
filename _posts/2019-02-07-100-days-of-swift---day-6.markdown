According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

Topic for Day 6 was: Closures, Part 1.

I'm used to how Ruby does closures, so it's going to take a little while for the Swift style and usage to really sink in.
