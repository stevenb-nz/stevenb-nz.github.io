According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 10 was: Classes.

This involved watching short videos on: Creating your own classes; Class inheritance; Overriding methods; Final classes; Copying objects; Deinitializers; Mutability; and Classes summary.
