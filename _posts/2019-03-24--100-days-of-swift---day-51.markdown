According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 51 was: Expanding your horizons.

This consisted of watching two videos: Elements of Functional Programming; and Teaching Swift at Scale.
