According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 35 was: Projects 7, Part Three.

This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 7. And some challenges, which I might not get to until tomorrow given how sleepy I'm starting to feel.
