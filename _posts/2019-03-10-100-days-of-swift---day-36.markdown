According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 36 was: Project 8, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; and Building a UIKit user interface programmatically (the video for this second part was over half an hour long).

Useful stuff to refer back to when I need or want to do things this way in the future.
