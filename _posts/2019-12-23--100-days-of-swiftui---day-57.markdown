According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 57 was: Project 12, part 1.

This included: Core Data: Introduction; Why does \.self work for ForEach?; Creating NSManagedObject subclasses; Conditional saving of NSManagedObjectContext; and Ensuring Core Data objects are unique using constraints.
