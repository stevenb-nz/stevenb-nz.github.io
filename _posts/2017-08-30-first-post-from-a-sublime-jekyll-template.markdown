The title should be fairly self-explanatory - just getting used to using this before starting a couple of more substantial posts.

I may need to type the double-quotes around the title when prompted for the title - just testing that now. No, not the problem.

The problem is that the insert datetime command in sublime-jekyll doesn't include the +1200 timezone at the end of the datetime, so the post was published, but wasn't going to appear until 13:19:51 server time, whenever that is (certainly still in the future right now). Maybe it's a setting, or maybe it's a change that could be made to sublime-jekyll - will investigate.
