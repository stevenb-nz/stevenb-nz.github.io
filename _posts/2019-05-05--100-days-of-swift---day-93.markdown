According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 93 was: Project 28, Part Two.

This consisted of a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 28, and some challenges.
