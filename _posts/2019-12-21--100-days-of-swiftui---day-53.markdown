According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 53 was: Project 11, part 1.

This included: Bookworm: Introduction; Creating a custom component with @Binding; Using size classes with AnyView type erasure; and How to combine Core Data and SwiftUI.
