Back after it was first released, I tried installing Visual Studio for Mac, but persistently had a crash immediately on clicking "Continue" in response to "By continuing, you agree to the License Terms" (a 'System.NullReferenceException' to be precise). Clicking OK to the unhandled exception window quit the installer, and the log text in this window was not selectable or copyable. So, I couldn't use the problem reporter in either the installer or the IDE, and couldn't provide more than screenshots to the Developer Community page.

Once I'd figured out where the installer logs were saved on my system, I *was* able to provide them to the Developer Community, which lead to a couple of rounds of 'try this new version' -> 'same crash, minor changes in the installer log'. Eventually I was told that the problem had been relayed to the team for further investigation, and they'd get back to me when more news was available.

Yesterday, I realised I hadn't heard anything for a couple of months or so, and went to check if there was a new version. The latest new version was from about a month ago, which I have now successfully downloaded and installed (having deleted a few watched iTunes U lectures to free up some disk space). Now to think of something to try it out on...
