According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 47 was Milestone: Projects 7-9.

This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.

The challenge was to write a "habit-tracking" app. Will start on this the next time through.
