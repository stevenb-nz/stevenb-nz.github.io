According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 14 was: Swift review, day two.

This involved reviewing these topics: Functions; Optionals; Optional chaining; Enumerations; Structs; and Classes.
