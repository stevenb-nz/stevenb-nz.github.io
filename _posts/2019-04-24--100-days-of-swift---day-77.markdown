According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 77 was: Project 23, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Basics quick start: SKShapeNode; Shaping up for action: CGPath and UIBezierPath; and Enemy or bomb: AVAudioPlayer.
