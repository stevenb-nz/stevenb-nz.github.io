According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 32 was: Project 6, part 1.

This included: Animation: Introduction; Creating implicit animations; Customizing animations in SwiftUI; Animating bindings; and Creating explicit animations.
