According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 35 was Milestone: Projects 4-6.

This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.

The challenge was to write an "edutainment" app for practising multiplication tables. I have created a new SwiftUI app, but done no coding yet. Will need to go back and revisit some previous days before continuing with this. Will continue with subsequent days in the meantime.
