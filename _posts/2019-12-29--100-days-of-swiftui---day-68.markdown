According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 68 was: Project 14, part 1.

This included: Bucket List: Introduction; Adding conformance to Comparable for custom types; Writing data to the documents directory; and Switching view states with enums.
