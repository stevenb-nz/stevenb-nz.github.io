According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 7 was: Closures, part two.

This involved watching short videos on: Using closures as parameters when they accept parameters; Using closures as parameters when they return values; Shorthand parameter names; Closures with multiple parameters; Returning closures from functions; Capturing values; and Closures summary.
