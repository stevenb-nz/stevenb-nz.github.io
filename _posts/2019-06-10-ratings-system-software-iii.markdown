Since the last time I posted on this topic, I've done the two-year review of the rating system I introduced at the beginning of 2017, and have implemented the resultant changes for the beginning of 2019.

I still haven't done a trial compilation of a Windows version. I also need to write up an explanation / worked example of how the new (2019) system is applied in practice.
