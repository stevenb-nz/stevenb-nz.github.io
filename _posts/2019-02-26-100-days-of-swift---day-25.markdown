According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 25 was: Project 4, Part Two.

This consisted of: Monitoring page loads: UIToolbar and UIProgressView; and Refactoring for the win.

More challenges tomorrow!
