According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 13 was: Swift review, day one.

This involved reviewing these topics: Variables and constants; Types of Data; Operators; String interpolation; Arrays; Dictionaries; Conditional statements; Loops; and Switch case.
