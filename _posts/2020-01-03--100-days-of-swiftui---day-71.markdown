According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 71 was: Project 14, part 4.

This included: Extending existing types to support ObservableObject; Downloading data from Wikipedia; and Sorting Wikipedia results.
