According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 54 was: Project 11, part 2.

This included: Creating books with Core Data; Adding a custom star rating component; and Building a list with @FetchRequest.
