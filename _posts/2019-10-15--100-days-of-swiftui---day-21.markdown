According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 21 was: Project 2, part two.

This included: Stacking up buttons; Showing the playerâ€™s score with an alert; and Styling our flags.
