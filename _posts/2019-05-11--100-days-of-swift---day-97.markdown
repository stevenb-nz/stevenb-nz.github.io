According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 97 was: Project 30, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; What are we working with?; What can Instruments tell us?; Fixing the bugs: slow shadows; and Fixing the bugs: wasted allocations.
