According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 25 was Milestone: Projects 1-3.

This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.

The challenge was to write a "Scissors, Paper, Stone" brain training app, which I have done to a very basic extent.
