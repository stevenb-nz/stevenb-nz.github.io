According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 62 was: Project 17, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Space: the final frontier; Bring on the enemies: linearDamping, angularDamping; and Making contact: didBegin().

Once I'd discovered the Project 17 files in the 'project23' folder, and realised that one of the files was capitalised where it wasn't in the presented code, everything worked just fine.
