According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 77 was Milestone: Projects 13-15.

This included sections on: What you learned, Key points, and a challenge.

The challenge was to write an app that asks users to import a picture from their photo library, then attach a name to whatever they imported. Will start on this the next time through.
