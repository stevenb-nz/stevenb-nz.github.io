According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 94 was: Project 29, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Building the environment: SKTexture and filling a path; and Mixing UIKit and SpriteKit: UISlider and SKView.
