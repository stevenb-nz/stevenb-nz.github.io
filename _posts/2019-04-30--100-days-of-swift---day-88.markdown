According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 88 was: Project 27, Part One.

This consisted of: Setting up; Creating the sandbox; Drawing into a Core Graphics context with UIGraphicsImageRenderer; Ellipses and checkerboards; Transforms and lines; and Images and text.

All good stuff.
