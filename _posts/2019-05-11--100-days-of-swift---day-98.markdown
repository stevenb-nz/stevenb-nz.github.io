According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 98 was: Project 30, Part Two.

This consisted of: Fixing the bugs: Running out of memory; a wrap up and review of what was learned in Project 30; and some challenges.
