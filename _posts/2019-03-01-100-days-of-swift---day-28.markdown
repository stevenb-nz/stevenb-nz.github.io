According to the rules for taking part in [100 Days of Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100), as soon as I've finished each day, I have to post about it.

The topic for Day 28 was: Project 5, Part Two.

This included: Prepare for submission: lowercased() and IndexPath; Checking for valid answers; and Or else what?.

Today's code was more in one of my sweet spots (i.e. dealing with words, strings, and combinations), so seemed to go quite smoothly.
