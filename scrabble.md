### old tournament scoring program

There are two .dmg's available for download - T-Score 1.4.1 compiled for i) [PPC Macs](/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.1(PPC).dmg) or ii) [Intel Macs](/assets/dmg/T-Score1.4.1(Intel).dmg). The PPC version hasn't been tested as I no longer have easy access to a PPC-based machine (or even one running Rosetta).
