## Scrabble Projects

### old tournament scoring program

[This folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o87m9vfi13ykrqo/AAD2HRFx3u3yfe7cVODJPBCOa?dl=0) at DropBox contains two .dmg's - T-Score 1.4.1 compiled for i) PPC Macs or ii) Intel Macs. The PPC version hasn't been tested as I no longer have easy access to a PPC-based machine (or even one running Rosetta).

## Learning Projects

### EDA final project (Rails)

### Advent of Code (Ruby)

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) was a series of code challenges (two related challenges each day) released each day of December through to Christmas 2015. I caught up with it after the fact in January, and got through to Day 12 ([rough solutions on GitHub](https://github.com/stevenb-nz/AdventOfCode)). If and when I get back to focussing on Ruby, I'm intending to do rough solutions to the remaining days, then go back through adding tests, and then refactoring.

### trial Electron project

\[ to come \]

### Ember front-end to Phoenix (Elixir) back-end?

\[ in due course, time permitting \]
