## Scrabble Projects

### old tournament scoring program

[This folder](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/o87m9vfi13ykrqo/AAD2HRFx3u3yfe7cVODJPBCOa?dl=0) at DropBox contains two .dmg's - T-Score 1.4.1 compiled for i) PPC Macs or ii) Intel Macs. The PPC version hasn't been tested as I no longer have easy access to a PPC-based machine (or even one running Rosetta).

* bingo hunters?

## Learning Projects
